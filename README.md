# Biscotti

A small flutter app which has the following functions to cure my laziness.

## Functions
- To record hour and minute of the subject the user add.
- To launch the applications that user has installed on their mobiles. Launching requires to answer a math multiplication quiz which level will increase after every successful       launch and also increase difficulty. (This function is for those who scares math like me lol. The more difficult multiplicatins quiz might cause the lesser desire to launch the    app. Game and social media Addiction cure for me).
- Last function is to select apps to track their usage time. Users can view the total amount of usage that they selected and can also set maximum usage to limit the daily usage of   the selected apps. (This function is just to view the usage hours not including notifications or other intrusive actions)
